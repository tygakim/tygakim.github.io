It's embarrassing. My first post on this blog was 'writing more often.'
Been almost a year since the last post. Not even close to 'more often.'

Shamelessly, I'm writing basically the same post as the first writing.
On top of that, I want to be more ambitious. Starting writing everyday challenge.

There's a beautiful man named Fred Wilson. A successful investor based in the states. (A partner at USV)

He runs a blog(avc.com) and writes every day since 2003.
The blog is one of my favorite readings. And even sometimes, I get the answers I need at that time from his writings.

As his blog inspired me and helped me, I hope my blog(and myself) could do the same in the future.
Day 1, Here I go AGAIN.
