This is the first post at nfr.ventures

I've always wanted to write more often. Even started a series called 'This week I've learned' and it turned into 'This month I've learned' and then..
I can rename it 'This decade I've learned' or so.

There's only one way to find out if you are good at swimming. You swim. If you don't swim, you can't even know whether you like swimming or not.
It's that simple.

Same goes with writing. Only one way to write more often.. I should write more often.
When we(at least I) try to write things, I care too much, plan too much.

hmm what should I write about, is this sentence gramatically right?
and I just fold my laptop. 'Maybe later.'

I don't let that happen tonight. I will just post it anyway.
